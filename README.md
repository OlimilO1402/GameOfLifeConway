# GameOfLifeConway
## Conways Game Of Life  
I immediately started this project in Aug.2008 when I encountered cellular automata for the first time.
You can play around with different death-life-rules. The original rule of Comway was 23/3
If you try rules 234/3 or 2346/3 you get structures that very much look like an amazing maze.
If you save it to a file you can import it in GamePathfinder. 
Maybe also have a look at the pathfinder project here:
